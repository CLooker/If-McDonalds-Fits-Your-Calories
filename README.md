# If McDonald's Fits Your Calories (IMFYC)

https://clooker.github.io/If-McDonalds-Fits-Your-Calories/

IFMYC is a nutritional app. When you hit the landing page, you can see a brief description of the app. Clicking on 'App' will bring you to a page with a field. Enter an amount of calories and click Submit. The app will return 3 meals composed of McDonald's menu-items that will be within 149 calories of your input.

I was responsible for all of the JavaScript logic that populates the meals. It mainly was achieved via API calls to the nutritionix API using randomly selected members of a pre-populated array of meal search terms. I had a lot of fun making this project!
